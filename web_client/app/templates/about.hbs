    The ADIOS Oil Database was designed to support oil spill response and oil spill preparedness operations
    through a compilation of publicly available oil assays. It includes physical and chemical properties, and
    data on these properties for oils that have undergone simulated weathering. Each record contains data about
    a single crude oil or petroleum product sample. Initial funding was provided by US Department of Interior,
    Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. The current version was first deployed March 2021.

    The data are presented as-is, the data have been reviewed to confirm its
    fidelity to the original sources. However, they are under continuous review,
    and we welcome notes if any errors are observed.
    The data in this database are aggregated from numerous sources,
    including the Environment and Climate Change Canada ESTS lab, SINTEF,
    NOFO, publicly-available assays from Exxon and other petroleum companies,
    and data collected by NOAA over the decades.
