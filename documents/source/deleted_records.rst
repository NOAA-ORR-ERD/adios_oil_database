Deleted Records
###############

In earlier vbersions of the ADIOS Oil Database, there were a number of duplicate records.
These were records that were often obtained from differeent sources, or from different editions of the the same source, and were inadvertantly included, even though they were, in fact the same data.

The duplicate records were removed in December of 2022.

If you have a ADIOS record (or ID number) from before that time, and can not find it in the current database, it may have been removed as a duplicate.

Below is a list of all the records removed, and the ID of the duplicate that was retained.

If you need the orignal record, they are all available as a JSON file in the gitHub project.

The IDs are links to the old record JSON, or they can be found on gitHub under the "Before-Duplicate-Removal" tag:
