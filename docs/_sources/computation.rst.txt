Computation with the ADIOS data
###############################

The core ``Oil`` object system was designed to managing the data -- lots of detail about exactly what data is there, the ability to anything to be missing, and units clearly defined with each value.

However, this makes it a bit awkward to work with if you want to do computation.

The :py:mod:`computation` sub-package provides a number of utilities that make it easier to do computation with the data.
