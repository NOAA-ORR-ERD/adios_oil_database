ADIOS Oil Database ``adios_db`` package
=======================================

The ``adios_db`` package is a Python package developed to help manage and work with oil properties data, as managed in the NOAA ADIOS Oil Database project:

http://adios.orr.noaa.gov

This package is used to provide the back-end services of the ADIOS Oil Database web application, and can also be used to work with the data directly itself.


There are three things one might want to do with this package:

1) Manage the data itself: search it, update it, add to it etc.
   See: :ref:`managing_the_data` for some documentation of this use case.

2) Extract numerical values from the data to use for computation,
   such as initializing an oil weathering model.
   See: :ref:`computation` for some documentation of this use case.

3) Extracting data needed for modeling. Oil weathering models need oil properties in order to apply the model to a particular oil. But each model requires different data, and each oil record provides different data. So building a "model oil" is non-trivial. See :py:mod:`adios_db.computation.gnome_oil` for an example of hownan `Oil` object as required by the GNOME oil weathering model is constructed from the data. Other models should be able to be supported with similar code.
