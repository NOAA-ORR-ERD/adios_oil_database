            - A single oil can be represented by one or more contiguous
              columns.  They can sometimes be grouped by name, although this
              is not always true, especially with the refined products.
              It seems that the ESTS code is the only reliable way of grouping
              them.
            - The ESTS code is the way they identify the samples they test,
              and it contains two or three numbers separated by a period '.'.
              The first number seems to identify the species of the petroleum
              substance, and the rest identify a degree of weathering,
              either natural or simulated in a laboratory.
            - We will return a dict with oil names as keys and a list of
              associated column indexes as values.

            Note: the April 2020 version of this datasheet has a single oil
                  record for which the ESTS code cells have been merged into
                  A single cell.  This has created a "gap" cell with a null
                  value.  So we need to remember the previous cell value.

            Column 0 contains field category names in which each single
            category is represented by a contiguous group of rows, and only

            needs to reference (category, property)
            A property name within a category is not unique.  For example,
            emulsion at 15C has multiple standard_deviation fields.

            There also exist rows that are not associated with any oil property
            which contain blank fields for both category and property.
