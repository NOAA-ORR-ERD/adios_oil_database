    A file reader for the Env. Canada .csv (.txt, actually) flat datafile.

    - The original source had a comma separated format with actual commas
      (',') as field separators.  This was insufficient, as some fields,
      notably the reference field, contained commmas in their content.

    - Each row represents a single measurement

    - There are a number of reference fields, i.e. fields that associate
      a particular measurement to an oil.  They are:

        - oil_id: ID of an oil record.  This appears to be the camelcase
                  name of the oil joined by an underscore with the ESTS
                  oil ID.
        - ests: ESTS ID of an oil record with one or more sub-samples

    - There are also a number of fields that would not normally be used to
      link a measurement to an oil, but are clearly oil general
      properties.

        - oil_name
        - date_sample_received
        - source
        - comments
        - reference

    - There are a number of fields that would intuitively seem to
      be used to link a measurement to a sub-sample

        - ests_id: ESTS ID of an oil sample
        - weathering_fraction
        - weathering_percent
        - weathering_method

    - And finally, we have a set of fields that are used uniquely for the
      measurement

        - value_id
        - property_id
        - property_group
        - property_name
        - unit_of_measure
        - temperature
        - condition_of_analysis
        - value
        - standard_deviation
        - replicates
        - method
