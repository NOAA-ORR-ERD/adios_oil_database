# conda requirements file for the oil_database package.
# These are the core requirements -- not much beyond
# Python 3.8 and numpy :-)

# see the conda_requirements_optional.txt file for
#   additional packages that might be useful

# These should all be in one of the following channels:
# 1: conda-forge
# 2: defaults

# It would be best to have these channels configured the order of precedence
# outlined above in your conda configuration.

python>=3.8.*,<3.10
numpy>=1.20
scipy  # used for gnome oil estimation -- for now

# for working with mongodb
mongodb>=4.2.0
pymongo<4

# this is only needed for some of the importing code.
# awesome-slugify>=1.6.5

# for downloading/importing data
openpyxl>=3.0.0
python-dateutil
# lxml>=4.4.1
requests>=2.22.0
