## Oil Database General Scripting Area

This is the general place we can put ad-hoc scripts which use the oil_database.

These are not intended to be installable via setup.py, but runnable within the scope of this folder (Or elsewhere).
There is a scripts folder within the oil_database module for installable scripts.

### scripts that work with a mongo database

This package provided various features for working with data in the ADIOS OIl Database. The data can be either in a collection fo JSON files, or in a MongoDB database for faster querying, etc.

scripts that use the MongoDB are in the mongo_scripts dir

The scripts in this dir are designed to work directly with the data in JSON files.
